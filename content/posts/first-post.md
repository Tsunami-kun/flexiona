# Introduction

This is an example academic post for the flexiona blog. The platform is designed to showcase research, ideas, and academic content with intelligent features.

## Example with LaTeX

LaTeX equations are supported in this blog:

$$E = mc^2$$

And inline math like $f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \hat{f}(\xi) e^{2\pi i \xi x} d\xi$ works too.

## Intelligent Features

This blog will automatically:
1. Connect related posts through vector similarity
2. Suggest color schemes for visual aesthetics
3. Recommend relevant images

All of these features are powered by a Python agent using LangChain and various AI models.
